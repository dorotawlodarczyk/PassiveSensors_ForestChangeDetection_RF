# Overview of the Project 

This project involves a comprehensive workflow for acquiring, processing, and analyzing satellite imagery from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 for land cover classification and change detection. The process includes searching for satellite images within specific geographic boundaries, calculating various spectral indices, validating forest cover predictions, and analyzing forest cover changes over time. The project leverages Python and several libraries such as GeoPandas, Rasterio, and Scikit-learn, among others, to handle geospatial data, perform raster operations, and apply machine learning techniques for classification tasks.

### Workflow Components

#### Land Cover Mapping (`LandCoverMapping_spectral`)
- **Objective**: Perform large-scale land cover classification using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery.
- **Features**:
  - Automated satellite image acquisition based on geographic, temporal, and cloud cover criteria.
  - Calculation of spectral indices to evaluate vegetation health and land cover characteristics.
  - Land cover classification using Random Forest models.
  - Model accuracy assessment against ground truth data.

#### Near-Real-Time Forest Change Detection (`NRT_ForestUpdate_spectral`)
- **Objective**: Provide detailed and timely updates on forest cover changes within specific subareas.
- **Features**:
  - Rapid image acquisition for designated subareas.
  - Automated extraction of spectral index values and application of Random Forest models for land cover classification.
  - Validation of classification accuracy and detailed analysis of forest gain and loss.
- **Implementation Note**: For full functionality of the NRT codes, it is essential to implement the following codes from the `LandCoverMapping_spectral` folder as part of the workflow: `Step4_AOIDivisionIntoSubareas.ipynb`, `Step5_GRIDCreation.ipynb`, and `Step7_RandomForestModelBuilding.ipynb` according to the provided workflow schema.
